  <h1>Hey! I’m Stefan — a lifelong learner, Software Engineer, and Solution Architect focused on building high-quality software systems.</h1>

<br>
I have over 10 years of experience in the IT industry, primarily working as a backend engineer specializing in C# and developing enterprise applications. Over the course of my career, I’ve taken on roles as a backend engineer, team lead, and software architect, where I was responsible for designing application architectures that emphasize maintainability, readability, performance, and adherence to both functional and non-functional requirements.

I’ve applied a wide range of architectural and design patterns—such as Clean Architecture and CQRS—to build distributed, event-driven systems. My experience also spans DevOps practices, including building CI/CD pipelines and deploying applications to platforms like AWS ECS and Azure AKS.

In addition, I’ve worked on building data pipelines and ETL processes, implementing both batch and stream processing with tools such as Apache Airflow, Kafka, and Apache Spark. My work has often placed me at the intersection of application development, solution architecture, DevOps, and data engineering.

Through this blog, I aim to share insights on the technical challenges I encounter and the lessons I learn from my craft.
