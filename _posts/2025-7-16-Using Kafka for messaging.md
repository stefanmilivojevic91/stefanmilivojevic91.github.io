title: Designing Data Intensive Application New Edition!
---

I just saw that a new edition of Designing Data-Intensive Applications is coming, expected in January 2026, according to O’Reilly, and I’m genuinely excited!

The first edition of this book by Martin Kleppmann has been one of the most insightful and widely recommended resources in system design and data engineering. I learned a ton about building reliable and scalable systems from it, and I consistently find myself coming back to it as a reference.

If you’re working with data or distributed systems and haven’t read it yet, you’re missing out. It’s one of those rare books that manages to be both deeply technical and incredibly readable.
Can’t wait to see what the second edition brings!
